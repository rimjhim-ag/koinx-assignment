Getting Started with Create React App
This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.

Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

npm start
Runs the app in development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.
You may also see lint errors in the console.

npm test
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about running tests for more information.

npm run build
Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified, and the filenames include hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about deployment for more information.

npm run eject
Note: This is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back!

This command removes the single build dependency from your project. Instead, it copies all the configuration files and transitive dependencies (e.g., Webpack, Babel, ESLint) directly into your project.

You can now fully customize your setup. All other commands (except eject) will still work, but they will use the copied scripts instead.

You donâ€™t have to use eject. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle-sized deployments.
